Air Quality in Different Countries

Target Browsers: Chrome, Firefox (any browser on a desktop or laptop computer basically)

API Used: emissions-api.org
https://emissions-api.org/
This API includes air quality data for every country on Earth, and measures four different things. Carbon Monoxide, Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide, and Ozone.

Visualizations: My main visualizations are a graph in Chart.js that displays the average Carbon Monoxide air quality data for the given country.

JS Library: I chose Chart.js because it seemed easy to create a bar chart with it using my API.

CSS Frameworks: Flexbox

Project Information: I am trying to show the air quality of every country, so users can explore and find out for themselves how different air quality is in different nations.
